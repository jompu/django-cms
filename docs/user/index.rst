To help you get up to speed with django CMS as a content editor and site manager, we have created
a site-in-a-box for you to work on as part of the :ref:`django CMS user tutorial <user-tutorial>`.

The tutorial takes you step-by-step through key processes. Once you've completed this you will be
familiar with the basics of content editing using the system.

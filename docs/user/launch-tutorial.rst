How to launch the django CMS Tutorial site
##########################################


There are three ways of launching the site.


*************************
Launch the site on Aldryn
*************************

Simply `sign up for a tutorial site <http://django-cms.org/tutorial-site>`_. This creates a free
account on Aldryn, the platform where the tutorial site runs.

You'll need to provide your email address and choose a password (if you already have an Aldryn
account, hit the **I'm already signed up** button.

Once you have successfully signed up, Aldryn will automatically create a new tutorial site for you
and deploy it. Within a couple of minutes it will open a new browser window with the home page
of the new site.

Take a note of the URL of this page, so you can return to it at any time.

Now :ref:`log in to your site <cms_login>` to continue with the tutorial.

.. note::


    The `Aldryn <http://aldryn.com>`_ platform is a cloud-based hosting service for django CMS
    projects. It has been developed by `Divio <http://divio.ch>`_, the company behind the free
    open-source django CMS project.

    Feel free to explore your `Aldryn account <http://control.aldryn.com>`_, where you can log in
    using the email address and password you provided above.

    Once you have completed the django CMS tutorial, you might also be interested in the `Aldryn
    tutorial <http://docs.aldryn.com/en/latest/tutorial/>`_ to introduce you to its features.

    There's also a built-in tour - just select the **Tour icon** to get started.
